    This project involves creating a informational-based website for a potential freelance professional or business website.
    I have chosen to make a basic personal photography website. Although I would have liked to made it more professional
    in the time I had.
    
    Functionality is shown through the navigation menu bar located at the top of the page, the user 
    inputs by clicking on any page they would like to go to and the output is the page opening to the user's view.
    This includes a Home, Works, Contact, and About pages. As well as the contact page, but it is currently inactive with
    accepting user input regarding user information.
    
    .html and .css were used in the makings of this page. 

    I have quite a few ideas for future improvements: 
    
    1. I was going to include bootstrap for an image carousel regarding the "home" page,
    but ended up making it difficult for myself to comprehend and probably should've asked for help.
    2. Filling the blank spaces surrounding the main focus. Either with a couple of icons, text boxes, or other decorations.
    3. Making the contact form functional.
    4. Putting a "container" class to have an easier time centering all pages.

    I realize there's a lot more work I still have to do on this.

    Web app zip will have to be downloaded as a zip.
